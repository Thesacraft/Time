# Time

This Programm shows you in the system tray how much time you have left and whether you can connect to the internet (for
example to see timelimits)
This Programm is written for Firefox and isn't compatiple with chrome out of the box(will maybe be updated in the
future)
This Programm doesnt work if you dont have a speedport(Telekom)
